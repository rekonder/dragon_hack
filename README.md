#Student.INFO - v0.3
**Dragon Hack Submission by Frikoti** - [view site](https://fri-student-info.firebaseapp.com/)

A webpage designed by and for students of FRI faculty of Ljubljana.
Our intent was to gather all relevant educational info on a single page from:  

* E-classroom  
* STUDIS exam data system  
* timetables  
* Relevant Facebook feed  

To achieve this, we used **Python 3** for data scraping, using following libraries:

 * **request** for html download  
 * **json** for dumping data to json files  
 * **BeautifulSoup4** for parsing html  
 
For serving webpages and frontend, we used **JavaScript** with **Twitter Bootstrap** framework, and hosted it on a DigitalOcean server.

**Potential development:**
  
 * Page personalization (multiple users, login system)  
 * Migration of data scraping to a faster library  
 * Scripts for periodical data acquisition  
 * Migration of webserver to Python  
 * Facebook feed display optimization (pause-on-hover...)  
 
**Developed by:**  

 * *ActoreX* (frontend support & Facebook API), 
 * *MikroMan* (backend & data scraping), 
 * *rekonder* (backend, server, frontend support),
 * *ziga.cernigoj* (frontend JavaScript & webpage design)
